# Machine Learning, Predicting Housing Prices

## Overview
The goal of this project is to perform EDA to explore the relationships between each variables and utilize various machine learning models to predict the housing prices based on different features. 

## Tools and Programming Language(s)
Jupyter, Python, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Process
1. Import all necessary libraries.
2. Conduct EDA to explore the data and its features.
3. Perform feature selection with scikit-learn to choose the best features.
4. Split and train the datasets.
5. Apply Linear Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree models to train the datasets.
6. Evaluate all the models and come up with the best suited model with the highest accuracy score. 

## Results
Random Forest Model has an accuracy score of 92.55% followed by the Decision Tree Model with a score of 91.16%.
